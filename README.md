Stat 436: Final Project

This repository will contain files of STAT 436 final project about Bayesian time series analysis

Presentation Tasks:

- We have learned a fair bit of classical time series in this course: what gap does your project topic fill? What different types of data does it allow us to analyze? **Michael**
  
- A background on the method: what makes it different from a modeling standpoint? **Youssef**

- What fields has this method been applied in successfully? What software packages (in `R`, Python, or other) exist to fit these types of models? **Youssef**

- A simple example of applying the method to data. This can be "toy" data if you would like, or even a simple application from a package vignette (if you do `?function`, there are usually examples of fitting on data). If you aren't sure how to make toy data, I can help **Ben**

- An introduction (does NOT need to be a full analysis) to the dataset that you chose for your final project. Some visualizations. Where did it come from, what is it? **Mads**
  
- A discussion of why you chose this dataset to illustrate your method. What strengths of your method / nuances of your dataset will allow for a more thorough analysis than using some of our methods from class? **Ben**

# Bayesian Analysis of Golden Eagle Counts

The primary question addressed in this project was whether Bayesian time series analysis could accurately model and forecast Golden Eagle counts in the Bridger Mountains. Our analysis revealed several insights and limitations. First, this was an exercise on the chaotic nature of real-world datasets. Handling missing data as well as having data only in specific season of the year was something that we did not encounter in textbooks example datasets. Secondly, the Bayesian model we considered demonstrated its utility in handling count data, a discrete response variable, and its ability to incorporate dynamic updates with additional data. The inclusion of the Sharp-Shinned Hawk rate as the sole predictor highlighted the correlation between this variable and the Golden Eagle counts. The Poisson Zellner prior was effective but it also introduced various biases and limitations. 

Furthermore, the seasonal component was the dominant part of the model, suggesting that local weather conditions might be less critical for Golden Eagle migration patterns, given their ability to traverse large distances. This aligns with ecological understanding but limits the explanatory power of the covariates. The wide prediction intervals for the 2024 forecast reflect the modeling limitations and highlight potential overestimation of the hourly Golden Eagle rate. 

Despite these challenges, the project provided valuable experience in applying regression analysis using a Bayesian analysis framework. It also underscored the importance of balancing computational efficiency with model precision, particularly when working with real-world ecological data. Future work could focus on refining the model by leveraging more sophisticated priors or alternative software platforms to improve accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, incorporating additional ecological or meteorological predictors, along with a more robust treatment of multicollinearity, might enhance model performance. As a final note, the project demonstrated the potential of Bayesian methods for ecological forecasting, paving the way for more nuanced analyses in similar contexts.
